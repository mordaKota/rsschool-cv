## Junior Frontend Developer (ex. Project Manager)

_Hi! It's Kate from Cyprus._

![This is me](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQE4X8LO3Ocuqw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1638974473653?e=1653523200&v=beta&t=P5fRROiuHPPVUKcSZjaKzk5QXUQuOy0GGiKxnI5xPao)

_Checking overheated labor market to find some frontend devs to my team one day, I felt jealous, I thought "These guys, probably, are lucky they have so many opportunities to select projects they are interested in and be very high-paid professionals working in a very comfy environment. No suits, no offices, no interactions with CUSTOMERS (oh, god)." "They have freedom." - that was my conclusion. I had some programming experience (html/css/vanila js, jira groove scripting, dax(power bi)). When I had scripting time, I felt really calm and logical. I remembered these moments in my working experience and my family told me I'm smart enough to change my job if I want. So, I'm here. The project management was very good, but I'm pretty soft and control-crazy for this kind of job, I burned out._

_I have everything to make a new journey in my life. The PM experience will be a good help to make me a Frontend Lead one day._
